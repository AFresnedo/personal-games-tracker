# Queries

* I wanted to get my tables setup before writing complex queries but I think
* I may need to prototype some queries first and then finalize my tables

* mulitple ratings
* similar people
* high ratings of this genre of games
* style and genre interchangable and comboable

# Tables

* users
    * no questions?
* games
    * central to all queries
        * so? do I have to be extra careful with this because of that?
            * or is it fine as it is?
                * offload complexity to other tables and the queries
                * themselves?
        * indexes
* played\_games
    * ratings should be multiple fields, not an array, correct?
        * does this depend on the queries?
* wishes

# Models

* a model for every table, even the simple ones like style, right?
