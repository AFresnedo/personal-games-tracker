# Data Scraping

## Sources

* greenmangaming
* amazon
* wikipedia
* gamepedia
* wookiepedia
* (fan-pedias)
* origin
* steam
* humble bundle
* (forums)

## Permanent

* isn't there something better than data scraping?
    * maybe data scrape -> create seed data
        * problem with this is that it isn't on demand
            * too many games to seed

* released games

## Dynamic

* upcoming releases (including early-access)

* careful...

# Trello

# UX

* easy import
    * can i import steam wishlist? origin? gog?
        * amazon, greenmangaming?

* compatiable with HLTB?
    * as in, use both....? hrm

# Styles

* this is what sets my game data apart
* this should be a table
    * need Brandi's help here
    * I want this to be a table but maybe it's just an array

## Table or Not

### Pros

* queries
* adding styles
* removing styles
* authorative list

### Cons

* requires query(s) to get a single game's styles
* how do I even link this? a massive join table?
    * games (many) to styles (many)
