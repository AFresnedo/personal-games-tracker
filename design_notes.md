# Data Scraping

## Permanent

* isn't there something better than data scraping?
    * maybe data scrape -> create seed data
        * problem with this is that it isn't on demand
            * too many games to seed

* released games

## Dynamic

* upcoming releases (including early-access)

* careful...

## Expansions / DLC

* these seem to murder my relational DB setup

# Trello

# UX

* easy import

* compatiable with HLTB?

# Database

* should I use mongoDB instead?
* it just seems that a relational setup is super simplistic
    * hard to justify usefulness/uniqueness
