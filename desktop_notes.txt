accounts/users
	- ease of access is a priority
		- never any question, ever, 100% this is most important
			- at least until it's popular but even then really
	- saving progress is a priority
	- security/privacy is a priority
		- MAKE THIS EVIDENT AT ALL TIMES (without being
		  intrusive/distracting/annoying)
twitch stuff
	- lets viewers see ratings for games played
		- "did you like it?"
			- generic overall rating mode
			- breakdown mode
				- graphics, etc
			- story/gameplay mode
				- fun but bad story
				- bad mechanics but great story
privacy
	- default is public view of games played / wishlist
		- and ratings / hype for each
		-options for turning each one off but also for group/tye
bot prevention
	- 2 dollar subscription for a year to prevent bots from voting
game info
	- wikipedia page link generated (or "wiki not found")
		- allow manual links regardless
			- good for not founds and for fan-based wikis
		- need to check more than just wikipedia
			- gamepedia, wookiepedia, shit like that
